          <description>There&apos;s just no substitute for a properly squeezed orange in the morning. So delicate and refreshing. The finest hotels use mechanical juicers of this type for their most discriminating guests. This is the largest selling juicer of its kind. It&apos;s a beautiful little all-metal piece in baked enamel and polished chrome; it even won the Frankfurt Fair Award for its design. Uses no electricity and produces no non-recyclable waste as do frozen juices.</description>

          <description>The Champion Juicer is the answer to every juicing problem. Because it operates on the mastication process principle, the Champion chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits. 
This give you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins and trace minerals. The juice will be a darker, richer color, with a sweeter, richer more full-bodied flavor.

          <description>You are not What You Eat, But What you Absorb.  The rate of absorption of juice has never been considered a factor in comparing juicers. With the introduction of Green Power&apos;s magnetic Twin Gear press, this has now changed. Experiments conducted by the Green Power Co. Research and Development Dept. show the rate of absorption of green juice using dual gear extraction is up to five times greater than using centrifugal extraction.</description>
